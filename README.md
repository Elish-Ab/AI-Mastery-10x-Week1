## Financial News and Stock Price Integration
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the correlation between news sentiment and stock movements using data analytics techniques. The analysis involves exploring news data, conducting sentiment analysis, and examining how it correlates with stock price movements. By leveraging Python, data analysis libraries, and financial tools, we aim to gain insights into how news sentiment impacts stock prices.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into tasks that cover Git and GitHub setup, exploratory data analysis (EDA), quantitative analysis using PyNance and TA-Lib, and correlation analysis between news and stock prices.

## Task 1: Git and GitHub
  Tasks:
  Setup Python environment
  Implement Git version control
  Configure CI/CD pipeline
  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
  Successful dev environment setup
  Demonstrated skills in version control
  Folder Structure:
  reasonml

Analyze correlation

# Getting Started
## To begin with the project:

Create a GitHub repository for hosting the project code.
Branch out for each task (e.g., "task-1", "task-2", "task-3").
Commit work with detailed messages.
Perform EDA on textual lengths, publication dates, sentiment analysis, and more.
Conduct quantitative analysis using PyNance and TA-Lib.
Analyze correlations between news sentiment and stock movements.
## Conclusion
This project offers a structured approach to understanding how news sentiment influences stock prices. By following the outlined tasks and minimum essential to-dos, we can explore and interpret the relationship between news data and stock movements effectively.
